Genocide 1.2GhzOC EB13 Kernel
for Samsung Epic 4G

http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=961614

How to compile: 
If you do not have the toolchain then get it from codesourcery.com and install/extract.  Since I am compiling on an Ubuntu VM I use http://www.codesourcery.com/public/gnu_toolchain/arm-none-linux-gnueabi/arm-2009q3-67-arm-none-linux-gnueabi-i686-pc-linux-gnu.tar.bz2
Browse to Kernel/arch/arm/configs/ and edit victory_03_defconfig and change the path for CONFIG_INITRAMFS_SOURCE=
Then refer to the README.txt on what else you need to change.

Changelog:
Wireless Tether fixes by mkasick http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=11808622&postcount=88 (should fix 4G tethering issues)
Keyboard patch by mkasick http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?p=11755093
Battery Status Polling Interval changed from 2000 to 30000 (30 seconds)
Added RNDIS support for Wired Tether (tested with easytether lite)
Added CONFIG_ARM_THUMBEE=y (as suggested by gzub)
Set 4k read ahead in mtd_blkdevs.c (faster boot?)
existz-initramfs-i9000-suckerpunch ported to Epic - broken right now
Removed CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO=y (gives us smaller kernel image and all modules including new cifs.ko)
CFLAGS_KERNEL	= -O2 -pipe -mcpu=cortex-a8 -mtune=cortex-a8 -mfloat-abi=soft -mfpu=neon
*Removed About Phone information (Caused FC and weird bugs in apps)
Fixed error that wouldn't let cpu drop below 200MHz


0.3a:
Set defaults speeds to 200MHz min and 1000MHz max (NOW REQUIRES SETCPU TO OVERCLOCK)
Compiled in video lag & camera force close fix by mkasick on xda-developers
Fixed issue with Firmware version in About Phone (FIXES PANDORA)
Set initramfs root UID/GID
Compiled and added cifs.ko to initramfs
*Removed cifs from kernel (you can try the module if you want but it broke the initramfs with it in there plus it is a nasty 2.3MB)

0.2a:
New EB13 initramfs (no more DK28 stuff)
-Added EXT4 Support
-Added bootanimation support
-Updated kernel modules from EB13
-Added recovery (need to test redirector)
-Added Firmware version to About Phone
Started on Voodoo mods

0.1a:
1.2GHz overclock
1Ghz 25mV undervolt
DK28 initramfs (for pre-EB13/OTA compatibility)

TODO:
Voodoo sound
Remove/raise framerate cap (know how but not doing until other tweaks are in first)
Tweak more voltages for better battery life (or use voltage control app)
Fix quickboot/redirector (3 finger salute works for now) RFS works fine, EXT4 gets stuck on boot logo
