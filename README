Genocide 1.2GhzOC EB13 Kernel
for Samsung Epic 4G

http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=961614

How to compile: 
If you do not have the toolchain then get it from codesourcery.com and install/extract.  Since I am compiling on an Ubuntu VM I use http://www.codesourcery.com/public/gnu_toolchain/arm-none-linux-gnueabi/arm-2009q3-67-arm-none-linux-gnueabi-i686-pc-linux-gnu.tar.bz2
Browse to Kernel/arch/arm/configs/ and edit victory_03_defconfig and change the path for CONFIG_INITRAMFS_SOURCE=
Then refer to the README.txt on what else you need to change.

Changelog:

0.3a:
Set defaults speeds to 200MHz min and 1000MHz max (NOW REQUIRES SETCPU TO OVERCLOCK)
Compiled in video lag & camera force close fix by mkasick on xda-developers
Fixed issue with Firmware version in About Phone (FIXES PANDORA)
Set initramfs root UID/GID
Compiled and added cifs.ko to initramfs
*Removed cifs from kernel (you can try the module if you want but it broke the initramfs with it in there plus it is a nasty 2.3MB)

0.2a:
New EB13 initramfs (no more DK28 stuff)
-Added EXT4 Support
-Added bootanimation support
-Updated kernel modules from EB18
-Added recovery (need to test redirector)
-Added Firmware version to About Phone
Started on Voodoo mods

0.1a:
1.2GHz overclock
1Ghz 25mV undervolt
DK28 initramfs (for pre-EB13/OTA compatibility)

TODO:
Voodoo mods maybe
Remove/raise framerate cap
Tweak more voltages for better battery life
Compile ext4 into kernel instead of using the kernel module in initramfs
Tweak with gcc flags
Fix quickboot/redirector (3 finger salute works for now) RFS works fine, EXT4 gets stuck on boot logo
